 There are three main states that your files can be in. They are;
Modified, Staged and Commited.

- Modified means that you have changed the file but haven't committed it to your database yet.

- Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.

- Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
