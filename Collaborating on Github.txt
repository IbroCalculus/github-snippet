- Create a branch to work on separately from the main branch ie git checkout -b BranchX1
- Add modifactions to staging area and commit changes on BranchX1
- DON'T merge  BranchX1 locally to the main branch, because it will override the main branch on the remote repo's main branch

- git push origin BranchX1


- Refresh Github repo and view BranchX1 branch
- Make a pull request to enable BranchX1 to be merged with the main branch

- Always git pull to make modication on repo files
