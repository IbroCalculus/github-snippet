A branch represent an independent line of development

============== CHECK PRESENT BRANCH YOU ARE WORKING ON ON LOCAL MACHINE AS WELL AS ALL BRANCHES ON LOCAL MACHINE ==============
	git branch

=========== LIST ALL BRANCHES ON REMOTE SERVER (i.e Github) ==============
	git branch -r

============= CHECK ALL BRANCHES, BOTH LOCAL AND REMOTE ============
	git branch -a

================= CREATE A NEW BRANCH ==================
	git branch NewBranch
 NB: Creating a new branch doesn't automatically switch to that branch, you have to switch as depicted below in other to work within it instead of the main or present br

================= SWITCH BRANCH ==================
	git checkout NewBranch		//This will switch from main to NewBranch	

============ CREATE A NEW BRANCH AND SWITCH TO THE NEW BRANCH CREATED =========== 
	git checkout -b NewBranch


================= SWITCH TO PREVIOUS BRANCH ==================
	git checkout -			<-- Returns to main branch

================= PUSH BRANCH TO GITHUB ==================
	git push -u origin NewBranch	OR	 git push --set-upstream origin NewBranch2	

================= DELETE BRANCH ON LOCAL MACHINE ==================
	Move out of the branch, then:
	git branch -d NewBranch	

==================== MERGE BRANCHES =============================
When it comes to merging two branches, it is best practice to be done via a pull request.

------------ METHOD 1 OF MERGING Main branch and NewBranch1 (not best practice) ==========
	git merge NewBranch1		\\Assuming you are already in the main branch

------------ METHOD 2 OF MERGING Main branch and NewBrach1 Using pull request) ==========
CHECK Tutorial; 1:20:00

	Open Github
	within the newBranch branch
	Select "Compare & pull request" or "New pull request"
	main <- newBranch
	Create pull request
	Merge pull request
	delete newBranch branch

==================== FIXING CONFLICTS WHEN MERGING BRANCHES ====================
Assuming main branch and Branch1
If changes were made to the main branch after Branch1 was created, trying to merge Branch1 to Main branch will result in a conflict.

To fix that, delete the line that appears with HEAD (Current Change) and (Incoming Change), again, add to staging area and commit.
